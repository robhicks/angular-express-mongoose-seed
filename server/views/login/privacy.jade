Unless you choose to identify yourself to us, by creating an account, you remain anonymous to the System. Cookies come in two flavors: session-based cookies and persistence-based cookies. Session-based cookies exist only during an online session. They disappear from your computer when you close your browser software or turn off your computer.

We may use persistence-based cookies that only we can read and use, to identify the fact that you are our customer or prior System visitor (whatever the case may be). We are especially careful about the security and confidentiality of the information stored in persistence-based cookies. For example, we do not store account numbers or passwords in persistence-based cookies. Users who disable their Web browsers' ability to accept cookies will be unable to use the System.
